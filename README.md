# Deep ML Code Challenges Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the machine learning code challenges from [Deep ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/). Each problem is implemented in Python and is organized within the `problems` directory.

## Directory Structure

- `problems/`: Individual Python files for each problem solution.
- `submit.py`: A script that automates the submission of solutions to the Deep ML platform.

## Submission Script

The `submit.py` script streamlines the submission process by reading each Python file in the `problems` directory, formatting the code, and sending it to the Deep ML submission endpoint. It prints the results of each submission to the console, indicating whether the solution passed or failed.

### Usage Instructions

1. Update `USER_TOKEN_HERE` in `submit.py` with your actual user token.
2. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python submit.py
   ```
